A pretty rudimentary worldgen mod that just adds a ton of world features to give vanilla biomes some much needed detail. As the name implies, mostly rocks. Also adds a rare giant-hive structure in flowery biomes, a weird absorbtion-granting block unique to said hives, spider nests in Dark Oak forests, and fairy circles in wooded areas, which may or may not have some secret uses. Only effects vanilla biomes.
